# Atomic design

A summarize from the book: [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) by Brad Frost

## Atoms

> **Atoms** are UI elements that can’t be broken down any further and serve as the elemental building blocks of an interface.

- [Basic HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that **can’t be broken down any further** without ceasing to be functional.
- Demonstrate all your base styles at a glance, which can be a helpful reference to keep coming back to as you develop and maintain your design system. But like atoms in the natural world, interface atoms don’t exist in a vacuum and only really come to life with application.

## Molecules

> **Molecules** are collections of atoms that form relatively simple UI components..

- For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.
- They make abstract atoms have purpose and meaning.
- These atoms and molecules emplifies the **single responsibility principle**, which says that a component should ideally only do one thing. By following this pattern, we can avoid creating components that are too complex and difficult to maintain. Burdening a single pattern with too much complexity makes software unwieldy.

## Organisms

> **Organisms** are relatively complex components that form discrete sections of an interface.

- An organism contain several small pieces of interface with their own unique properties and functionality. These pieces can be similar or dissimilar.
- For example, _nav bar_ is an organism that might consist of a logo, primary navigation, and search form. These children elements are molecules and atoms, each one with its own responsibility.
- An organism can standalone as a section in a page, we can easily recognize them. Another examples:
  - _A header organism might consist of dissimilar elements such as a logo image, primary navigation list, and search form._
  - _A footer organism might consist of a copyright statement, secondary navigation list, and social media icons._
  - _A product grid organism might consist of product cards that each contain an image, title, price, and “add to cart” button._

## Templates

> **Templates** place components within a layout and demonstrate the design’s underlying content structure.

- They are are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure.
  - provides context for these relatively abstract molecules and organisms.
  - **focus on the page’s underlying content structure** rather than the page’s final content.

## Pages

> **Pages** apply real content to templates and articulate variations to demonstrate the final UI and test the resilience of the design system.

- Apply real content to templates and articulate variations to demonstrate the final UI and test the resilience of the design system.
- Pages also provide a place to articulate variations in templates, which is crucial for establishing robust and reliant design systems.
  - _For example, the dashboard pages for different tenants are different, but the layouts are the same._
